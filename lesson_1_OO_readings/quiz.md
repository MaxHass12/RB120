1. Programming in an OO way does not necessarily result in writing less code.

2. Objects are instances of classes and does not inherit from other class - Classes inherit from other class.

3) A mixin module provides a collection of behaviors to one or more classes. An alternative way of sharing

4) Ruby accompalished encapsulation by creating objects and exposing interfaces ie methods to interact with those objects. The term encapsulation means hiding functionality and making it unaavailable to the rest of the code base.

5) Class Inheritence is a way to form specialized special classes from the general classes that exist.

6) Polymorphism is the ability of different object types to react to the same method call in different ways. Method overriding is one way in which Ruby implements polymorphism.

7) Class inheritance lets us exctract common behaviour from many classes to a super class. It let us models concepts which are naturally hierarchical.

8) `self` outside the scope of instance method refers to the class itself and not the instance of the class.
